- 👋 Hi, I’m @ClaireHappel
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Learning how to code for a living. I've got 4 years experience in QA testing, Network Operations, and IT: this seems like the next logical step to my career. I'm also generally interested in stocks, micros/macros related to investing stemming from geopolitical events, adult and criminal psychology, poetry and writing, Dungeons and Dragons and other equally nerdy endeavors.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML and Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything learning related, I'll update this page when I think I'm ready to tackle projects with others.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Please email me at clairehap1@gmail.com - I'll be posting projects as I learn, and diving into making my own projects later on.
